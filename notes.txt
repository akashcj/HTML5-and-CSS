The main file of any website is normally called index.html

The first tag of any html file should be <!DOCTYPE html>

HTML has tags <h1> to <h6> for specifying headings, <h1> being the largest

To bold text, use <strong>Text to Bold</strong>
For italic text, use <em>Text to italicize</em>
To add a new line, use <br>

The <img src="image location" alt="alt text if image not displayed"> elementis used to display images, and has no closing tag. 

The <a href="destination link" target="_blank">Link Text</a> is used to create a link into the document. However, the target can be set to _blank to have the link open in a new tab.

STYLESHEET LINKING
To link a Stylesheet, in the <head> section, use <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="link to style sheet">. This tag doesn't have a closing tag.

CSS SYNTAX: 
e.g. 
h1 {
	color:green;
	font-family:Arial, Calibri;
	font-size:40px;
}

The "h1" above is the selector, and we can select multiple elements to be styled at a go like h1,h2{}, which can hold the common styles for both h1 and h2, with the different values still being inside the individual h1{} and h2{} selectors.

If we have a style applied to the body{} element in CSS, it will be applied to all elements, irrespective of whether they are styled or not, unless they are styled separately -- CSS inheritance.

CSS colors
colors in CSS are specified using the color names, hex format, or an rgb notation specifying transparency.
e.g. color specification: 0xabcdef -- 0xab is the value for red, cd is the value for green and ef is the value for blue. 
When using transparency, you would need to specify a value of the form: rgba(2,2,2,0.4), which will result in a color with 40% transparency.
Note: Setting all the R, G and B values to the same will give a grey color
Note: In the Brackets editor, pressing Ctrl+E when on a color brings up the color editor.

CSS selectors can select a class like .class-name, and select ids like #id-name.

CSS Box Model: A CSS element has properties like margin, border, padding, which specify the distance of an element from its edges in various ways. All of these properties can be set for the top, left, bottom and right sides.

Margin -- space from an element's border to external elements
Padding -- space from border to actual element
border -- a line around the element, after accounting for the padding
width,height -- width and height of the element only.
To be able to specify the width and height of the element inclusive of the padding (that is, till the borders), we can set a css property called box-sizing, which we can set to border-box.

All the above margin, padding and border values can be set for each side e.g. margin-bottom, margin-top, margin-left, and values can be set in px, % and as "auto".

values can be set at a go for all 4 sides, e.g. margin: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>

specifying the border needs us to specify 3 things - border width, line type and color
e.g. border: 1px solid #8e8e8e;

Block Elements: Use the full width of the browser -- e.g. headings and paragraphs

Inline Elements: don't use the full width

The CSS * selector: applied to all elements of the page

css float property -- when applied to an element, determines how the elements position itself around other elements in the parent container, as oppossed to absolute positioning. float can have values of left, right, none and inherit.

CSS syntax: 
.<class_name> <element_type> ==> selects all elements of type given, under a containing element with class set to class_name.
e.g. .author_box img {}


img border-radius:50% will give a circular image.

Abosolute Positioning:

if the positioning of the parent element is relative in the css (positioning: relative), we can use the style (position:absolute) for a chid element, and specify the absolute top and left values of the element, inside the parent element.

Desigining Guidelines: 
Body text should be between 15px and 25px (depends on the font and the amount of text)
Headlines should be bigger than normal text. Increasing the Font Size may require reducing the font-weight.
Use Line Spacing between 120% and 150%
Line Length -- 25 to 90 characters per line, unless you have columns

Use a single base color
Create Darker and Lighter versions of the base colour, to use on the webpage.
Never user Black in any part of the design, as black doesn't occur normally in the 
real world

Using Images:
When text is on top of images
Image Overlay
Image Blur
Floor Fade -- Where the image fades into black at the bottom, where there is text

Using Icons:
Icons should be recognizable
If possible, Icons should be labelled
Icons should not be the center of the design -- it should support the main theme
Icon Fonts are vector based as they scale endlessly up/down for any resolution

Designing Layout using Whitespace:
Put whitespace between elements, groups of elements and sections, but don't exaggerate
Use whitespace to build content flow -- not sure how though :)

Media Queries: allows us to specify various css values for different browser width

When designing an h1 block, we can do the follow to get the letters and words space out, and reduce the font weight (by default h1s are bold). Font sizing can be specified as a percentage of the parent element's font value.

h1 {
    font-size:240%
    font-weight:300;
    text-transform:uppercase;
    letter-spacing:1px;
    word-spacing:4px;   
}

css display attribute
inline, block, and inline-block

inline elements cannot have a width and height set. They also allow other elements to sit next to them. They only follow left and right padding/margin rules, not top/bottom.
block elements will take up the entire browser width if their width is not set, and force a line break after it, that is not allow any other element to sit next to it. However, they allow padding/margin on all 4 sides. They also allow their width and height to be set.
inline-block elements allow other elements to sit to the left and right of themselves, allow margin/padding on all 4 sides and allow their width and height to be set.

css elements can have states, e.g., an <a> element can have a state of link (normal state), visited(after visited), hover(when the mouse is over) and active (when we click on the element)
e.g. if an a element has been decorated with a "special-a" class, we can target one of the above states in css using
special-a:link{
color: green;
}
we can also target multiple states together by using a "," symbol to separate out 2 selectors.
e.g. 
special-a:link, special-a:visited{
color:green;
}
In the above case, both visited links and not visited links would look the same
